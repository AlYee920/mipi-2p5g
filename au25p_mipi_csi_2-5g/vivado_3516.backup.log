write_hwdef

Description: 
Writes hardware definition for use in the software development

Syntax: 
write_hwdef  [-force] [-quiet] [-verbose] <file>

Returns: 
success/failure status of applied action.

Usage: 
  Name        Description
  -----------------------
  [-force]    Overwrites the existing hardware definition file
  [-quiet]    Ignore command errors
  [-verbose]  Suspend message limits during command execution
  <file>      Hardware definition file (Values: A filename with alphanumeric 
              characters and .hwdef extention.) 

Categories: 
Project

Description:

  Writes a hardware definition (.hwdef) file for use in the software
  development tools (SDK).

  The write_hwdef command is intended to simplify the movement of designs
  from the Vivado Design Suite to software development in SDK. This command
  is run automatically by the Vivado Design Suite when generating the output
  products for a top-level design that includes a block design with an
  embedded processor like MicroBlaze, or Zynq-7000 SoC. Block designs are
  created in the IP integrator of the Vivado Design Suite with the
  create_bd_design command.

  Each Block Design and HIP generates a hardware container file with .hwdef
  extension. The container file includes device metadata and hardware design 
  files.

  The write_hwdef command returns nothing if successful, or an error if the
  command fails.

Arguments:

  -force - (Optional) Overwrite and existing hardware definition file if one
  exists. If this option is not specified, then the Vivado Design Suite will
  not overwrite an existing file.

  -quiet - (Optional) Execute the command quietly, returning no messages from
  the command. The command also returns TCL_OK regardless of any errors
  encountered during execution.

  Note: Any errors encountered on the command-line, while launching the
  command, will be returned. Only errors occurring inside the command will be
  trapped.

  -verbose - (Optional) Temporarily override any message limits and return
  all messages from this command.

  Note: Message limits can be defined with the set_msg_config command.

  <file> - (Required) Specify the name of the hardware definition file. The
  file can include the path and file extension. The default file extension of
  .hwdef is used if an extension is not specified.

  Note: If the path is not specified as part of the file name, the file will
  be written into the current working directory, or the directory from which
  the tool was launched.

Examples:

  The following example creates the specified hardware definition file:

    write_hwdef  -force C:/Data/ug940/lab1/zynq_design.hdf

Resolution:
1) Ensure that the clock signal connected to the debug core and/or debug hub is clean and free-running.
2) Ensure that the clock connected to the debug core and/or debug hub meets all timing constraints.
3) Ensure that the clock connected to debug core and/or debug hub is faster than the JTAG clock frequency.

WARNING: [Labtools 27-3361] The debug hub core was not detected.
Resolution: 
1. Make sure the clock connected to the debug hub (dbg_hub) core is a free running clock and is active.
2. Make sure the BSCAN_SWITCH_USER_MASK device property in Vivado Hardware Manager reflects the user scan chain setting in the design and refresh the device.  To determine the user scan chain setting in the design, open the implemented design and use 'get_property C_USER_SCAN_CHAIN [get_debug_cores dbg_hub]'.
For more details on setting the scan chain property, consult the Vivado Debug and Programming User Guide (UG908).
